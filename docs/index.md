# Welcome to my personal documentation!
This repo contains some documentation on various topics so I can refresh my knowledge when I need to. It mostly contains things I have a hard time remembering, or that may be diffucult to find on the internet, but I may add anything to it that I like or find useful at any point.


I decided to put it online at the request of some colleagues and for anyone who may stumble upon it.
