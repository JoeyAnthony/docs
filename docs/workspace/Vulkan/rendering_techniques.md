# Rendering Techniques
Some rendering techniques I stumbled upon

## Clustered Forward shading
- [Clustered Forward shading](https://www.reddit.com/r/GraphicsProgramming/comments/1afo85n/my_vulkan_rendering_engine_now_has_clustered/)

Cool comment from the [blog](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Generating_Mipmaps):

```
I toyed around with the code, added an extra ubo+descriptor for a point light source and rewrote the shaders for Blinn-Phong reflection. As an extra feature I implemented timestamp queries in the command buffer recording so I could measure GPU rendering time. Thankfully, the obj. model contains vertex normals as well.
Thank you so much for these tutorials - they are still (2021) very appreciated! xD
